Setting up the Flow Timer
by Justin Ge

First to clarify, this only works on Windows software.
Secondly, a guardian or parent or adult should be doing this, not a child/teenager.

As a precaution of the removal of this program, move the zip or folder to: 
C:\Program Files

1.Extract the Flow Timer zip.

2.Delete the zip but keep the Flow Timer folder.

3.Press Win + R. You should have a run application open.(Keep the Flow Timer folder open!)

4.Click the bar next to "Open: " and write: shell:startup
						(no spaces.)
5.You should be in the Startup folder. Go back to the Flow Timer folder and go to the "Run".

6.Right-click and hold, then drag your mouse to the Startup folder.

7.A menu should appear. Press the selection: "Create shortcut here"

Congratulations! You are finished setting up your Flow Timer! Now just close the files.
Soon the child or teenager should have to set a timer.

If your child or teenager gets a blank screen, with a password box, enter the following 
password: prg0p   Then, press "Submit". The user should now be able to access the
computer prior the next startup.
